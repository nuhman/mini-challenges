# Type-Ahead Input  
  
## Aim
Build a **typeahead** or **autocomplete** search input that will provide the 5 most matching **github** usernames based on your input. Suggestions should be real-time. Add *debounce* function to only search 1s after user have stopped typing.

*Note*: Should you encounter any issues with API requests, it might be due to GitHub's rate limiting on their public API for unauthenticated requests. This typically occurs after exceeding their quota for free tier usage and is often reset after some time. Please try again later.
